Due to the increasing, no of solar\npower plants, day by day in the energy sector, and reduction of\ndependency on fossil fuels, prediction of solar power generation\nis necessary for future planning for smart grid integration.\nForecasting techniques are employed to tackle a wide range of\nproblems, such as renewable energy generation, electric load and\nprice, demand-side management, the financial & banking sector,\nhealthcare, stock market, and cyberspace security prediction,\netc. In the time-series dataset, there is information related to the\ntime that can be used to predict and analyze data. Machine\nLearning algorithms such as Facebook (FB) Prophet and\nExtreme Gradient Boost (XGB) are used for predicting solar\nenergy generation on a monthly and weekly basis. From this\nproposed research, it concluded that the XGB model is efficient\nto forecast in terms of better prediction and better fitting than\nthe FB prophet model. RMSE, MAPE, and MAE parameters are\ncalculated to check the performance of the time series model.",

In light of the widespread\nuse of renewable energy sources and distributed generation,\nthere is an ever-increasing interest in integrating solar power\ninto utility grids.

This effectively transforms the passive,\nunidirectional grid into an active, bidirectional, and\nintelligent grid. A growing number of devices and systems\nare continuously connected to participants in the power grid.\nConsequently, the smart grid generates and exchanges\nmassive amounts of data between different entities.

In June 2020, solar\nenergy had an installed capacity of 35 GW in India and would\nreach 100 GW by 2022. The solar mw generation profile is\nnot fixed due to rapid changes in atmosphere conditions which\nleads to grid integration issues. In order to avoid this issue,\nthere is a need of accurate solar power generation information\nto balance between the power generation and utilities and grid\n[2, 3] . As a result, a suitable day-ahead forecast model of\nsolar power is necessary for optimal PV-based grids, as\nintroduced in [4, 5] . In this paper, we have obtained time\nseries data of solar MW generation, which work as an input.\nXGB and a Facebook Prophet technique are used to predict\naccurate solar MW output and compare results in terms of\nMAPE, MSE and MAE.

Due to the high seasonality\nin dataset, XGB and Facebook Prophet handle the large data\neffectively. In future work, a deep learning technique which\nmay handle a large amount of data will be used to improve\nthe prediction error. A shorter duration of solar power\ngeneration data could also be used for further improvement\nof results.",
